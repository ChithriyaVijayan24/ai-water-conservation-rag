Water conservation helps reduce water scarcity and protects natural ecosystems.
Simple ways to save water include fixing leaks, turning off taps while brushing,
using buckets instead of long showers, and reusing water for plants.

Students can contribute to water conservation by reporting leaks,
using water efficiently, and spreading awareness among peers.

Communities play an important role by adopting rainwater harvesting,
efficient irrigation systems, and public awareness programs.

Responsible water usage supports Sustainable Development Goal 6:
Clean Water and Sanitation and ensures water availability for future generations.
