Water conservation helps reduce water scarcity and protects natural ecosystems.
Simple ways to save water include fixing leaks, turning off taps while brushing,
using buckets instead of showers, and reusing water for plants.

Government and environmental agencies encourage rainwater harvesting,
efficient irrigation methods, and public awareness to reduce water wastage.

Responsible water usage supports Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation.
